# Environment setup for Ubuntu
This repository is a collection of scripts and configurations for setting up a Linux environment geared towards development in a shell. It is designed for an Ubuntu/Debian-based AMD64 machine using a bash shell, but can be easily adapted otherwise.

## Prerequisites
A Nerd Font should be installed and enabled in the terminal to properly display the glyphs in the command prompt.

## Usage
Clone this repository into a folder that is intended as a source (e.g. `~/.usr-setup`) and run `setup.sh`.

## Notes
`vim/autoload/clip.vim` is a vim command for WSL2 distributions that allows copying text selected in Visual mode to the clipboard of the Windows machine. It can be omitted for non-WSL2 enviroments.
